Vcpkg example, executable not included on the path ):
D:\src\cmake-test\build> cmake .. "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:\src\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake"
# correct for my win machine
cmake .. "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:\Users\jack\git\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake"

when installing defaults to 32 bit versions of everything for some reason, need
vcpkg install libname:x64-windows

"vcpkg integrate install" makes libraries available to Visual Studio, but VSCode intellisense seems flaky.

if vcpkg.json in current directory, vcpkg will install libraries into a vcpkg_installed subdirectory.
